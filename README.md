# Auto-File-Renamer
## Automatic File Renamer can be used to reorder the sequence of files. The only way to set an order is to rename the files in a certain way
###### Below are the variables you need to set for the script to work

```
current_directory = "PATH OF EXISTING FILES"
new_directory = "PATH OF NEW DIRECTORY"
```

The script takes a metadata.csv as input where the first column has the name of the file. The order of the files is determined from the position of the row.
